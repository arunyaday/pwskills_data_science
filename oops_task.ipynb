Basically, the main purpose of using getters and setters in object-oriented programs is to ensure data encapsulation. Private variables in python are not actually hidden fields like in other object oriented languages. Getters and Setters in python are often used when:\n",

    "#### Q5.What is method overriding in python? Write a python code to demonstrate method overriding.\n",
    "Ans: Method overriding is an ability of any object-oriented programming language that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class."
