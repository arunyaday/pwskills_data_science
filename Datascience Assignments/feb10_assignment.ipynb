    "#### Q5. Explain why with statement is used with open(). What is the advantage of using with statement and open() together?\n",
    "Ans: In Python, with statement is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supporting with statement in your objects will ensure that you never leave any resource open. To use with statement in user defined objects you only need to add the methods __enter__() and __exit__() in the object methods. Consider the following example for further clarification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using with statement and open() together is that it helps avoid common errors that can occur when working with files, such as forgetting to close a file after opening it or not handling exceptions properly. By using the with statement, you can ensure that the file is closed properly, even if an exception is raised during the execution of the block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using with statement and open() together provides a cleaner and safer way to work with files in Python, ensuring that files are properly opened and closed and making the code easier to read and maintain.\n"
