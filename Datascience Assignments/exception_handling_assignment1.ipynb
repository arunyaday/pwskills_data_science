    "#### Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "Ans: An Exception is an error that happens during the execution of a program. Whenever there is an error, Python generates an exception that could be handled. It basically prevents the program from getting crashed.\\\n",
    "Many a time, there are valid as well as invalid exceptions. Exceptions are convenient in many ways for handling errors and special conditions in a program. When we think that we have a code which can produce an error, we can use exception handling technique.\\\n",
    "we can raise an exception in our program by using the raise exception statement. Raising an exception breaks current code execution and returns the exception back until it is handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diffrence: Errors cannot be handled, while Python exceptions can be handled at the run time. An error can be a syntax (parsing) error, while there can be many types of exceptions that could occur during the execution and are not unconditionally inoperable. An Error might indicate critical problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch, while an Exception might indicate conditions that an application should try to catch. Errors are a form of an unchecked exception and are irrecoverable like an OutOfMemoryError, which a programmer should not try to handle.\n",
